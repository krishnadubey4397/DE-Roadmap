Ques: Explain the time complexity of checking for an element's existence in a list vs. a set.   
Ans: Considering the worst case time complexity the list will have time complexity of O(n), if the element is found at the last index using linear search and the set will have the time complexity of O(1) as it stores unique elements and it uses hash table for accessing the element's existence in a set.
